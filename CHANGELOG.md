# Changelog

All notable changes to Orbit Ops. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions follow `VERSIONING.md`. Write entries for someone reading them in a year: what changed
and why it matters, not what the diff says.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The station is built: a FastAPI app with login, a dashboard placeholder and `/healthz`
  (reports the version the image was built as, so a deploy can be verified).
- Security carried over from Budget Buddy: argon2 password hashing, signed session cookies that
  can be revoked by rotating a per-user token, CSRF on every POST (htmx header or form field), a
  login rate limit (10/min), and a nonce-based Content-Security-Policy with framing denied.
- PostgreSQL schema managed by Alembic, with a least-privilege `orbit_app` role whose grants
  extend automatically to tables added by future migrations.
- Docker image (non-root, digest-pinned base, fully pinned dependencies) and a compose file sized
  for the droplet it shares with Budget Buddy: no published database port, 256 MB caps.
- CI (ruff, tests against real Postgres, a migration round-trip, image build), changelog and
  acceptance-criteria checks, and a Release workflow that backs up, migrates, deploys and verifies
  — plus a manual Rollback.
