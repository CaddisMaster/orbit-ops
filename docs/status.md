# Status

A per-session log, standing decisions and a release ledger. Newest first.

## Standing decisions

- **Stack:** FastAPI + Jinja/htmx + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic (chosen 2026-10-08 to learn a new
  backend while keeping the server-rendered frontend). Sync routes first; async is a later lesson.
- **One uvicorn process**, no Redis, no scheduler container — RAM on the shared droplet.
- **Content in git**, AI for hints / lab review / drafting (the "hybrid" option).
- **Single user**, but every learner-state query is user-scoped.

## Release ledger

| Version | Date | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0 | 2026-10-08 | Skeleton live at learn.seandesmet.com; pipeline proven end to end; app on `orbit_app` |

## Sessions

### 2026-10-08 — project bootstrap

- Planned the app (`docs/roadmap.md`) and built milestone v0.1.0's skeleton: the app, auth,
  security headers, CSRF, rate limit, Alembic (users + the `orbit_app` role), Docker, CI,
  release/rollback workflows, docs, and the Claude setup. 26 tests passing; CI green on the
  first push.
- GitHub: the repo is public, squash-only, with branch protection (Lint, Tests, Image builds,
  changelog, criteria), secret scanning + push protection, and labels. The `production`
  environment exists with a required reviewer, and the repo var `DROPLET_USER=deploy` is set.
- Milestone **v0.1.0**: #1 droplet setup, #2 cut v0.1.0 + least-privilege role, #3 port the
  `gotcha-auditor` / `release-prep` agents. v0.2.0 issues filed without a milestone: #4 content
  schema/loader, #5 quizzes + completion, #6 syllabus + Unit 1.1.
- Budget Buddy's RUNBOOK now records the shared droplet (BB #478 / #479).
- Notes are set up like BB's: `CLAUDE.local.md` → `personal-vault`, memory in
  `personal-vault/claude/memory/orbit-ops`, diary and reference notes in
  `obsidian-vault/Orbit Ops/`.
- **Shipped v0.1.0 the same day.** Droplet setup (#1) was done from the Mac: DNS, Nginx, a
  single-name Certbot lineage, `/opt/orbit-ops` and `.env`, and a **new dedicated deploy key**
  (BB's private key exists only in BB's GitHub secrets, so it couldn't be copied, and a
  per-app key can be revoked on its own). Release run `37826926927`: smoke test passed, deploy
  approved, backup taken, migrations run, `0.1.0` verified. Then the app was switched to
  `orbit_app` and the learner account created on production (#2).
- The ghcr package came out public on its own (public repo), so the droplet needs no
  `docker login`.
- Found while verifying: `HEAD` returns 405 (#9).
- **Next:** milestone v0.2.0 (Learn loop): #4 content schema/loader, #5 quizzes + completion,
  #6 syllabus + Unit 1.1, plus #3 (agents) and #9 (HEAD). Start with #4, because #5 and #6
  depend on its format.
