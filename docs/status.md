# Status

A per-session log, standing decisions and a release ledger. Newest first.

## Standing decisions

- **Stack:** FastAPI + Jinja/htmx + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic (chosen 2026-10-08 to learn a new
  backend while keeping the server-rendered frontend). Sync routes first; async is a later lesson.
- **One uvicorn process**, no Redis, no scheduler container — RAM on the shared droplet.
- **Content in git**, AI for hints / lab review / drafting (the "hybrid" option).
- **Single user**, but every learner-state query is user-scoped.

## Sessions

### 2026-10-08 — project bootstrap

- Planned the app (`docs/roadmap.md`) and built milestone v0.1.0's skeleton: the app, auth,
  security headers, CSRF, rate limit, Alembic (users + the `orbit_app` role), Docker, CI,
  release/rollback workflows, docs, and the Claude setup. 26 tests passing; CI green on the
  first push.
- GitHub: the repo is public, squash-only, with branch protection (Lint, Tests, Image builds,
  changelog, criteria), secret scanning + push protection, and labels. The `production`
  environment exists with a required reviewer, and the repo var `DROPLET_USER=deploy` is set.
- Milestone **v0.1.0**: #1 droplet setup, #2 cut v0.1.0 + least-privilege role, #3 port the
  `gotcha-auditor` / `release-prep` agents. v0.2.0 issues filed without a milestone: #4 content
  schema/loader, #5 quizzes + completion, #6 syllabus + Unit 1.1.
- Budget Buddy's RUNBOOK now records the shared droplet (BB #478 / #479).
- Notes are set up like BB's: `CLAUDE.local.md` → `personal-vault`, memory in
  `personal-vault/claude/memory/orbit-ops`, diary and reference notes in
  `obsidian-vault/Orbit Ops/`.
- **Next:** #1 is Sean's, from the Mac (the VM cannot reach the droplet by design), including the
  three `production` secrets. Then #2: publish v0.1.0, approve it, set the `orbit_app` password,
  and create the account on production.
