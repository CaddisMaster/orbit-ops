"""Every acceptance-criteria scenario a PR's issues promise must be claimed (BB #358).

Feature issues carry Gherkin acceptance criteria, and until this check the
criteria and the tests were connected only by whoever read the issue that day.
A dropped scenario closed with its PR and left no trace but prose in a closed
issue.

For each issue the PR closes, this reads the `Scenario:` titles under the
issue's "Acceptance criteria" heading, and requires each to be CLAIMED by one of:

  * a `.feature` scenario under tests/features/ with that title, tagged
    `@issue-<n>` (on the scenario, its Rule, or its Feature);
  * a pytest test decorated `@pytest.mark.criterion(<n>, "<title>")`;
  * a line in the PR body: `Verified by hand: #<n> "<title>" — <why>`,
    for a criterion that is a statement about docs or process rather than
    something a test can hold.

Titles match case-insensitively with whitespace collapsed. Anything unclaimed
fails the check and is named.

⚠️ CORRECTING A WRONG SPEC IS MEANT TO BE CHEAP. Issues here are regularly
wrong on contact with the code (BB #243, BB #246, BB #326, BB #314). Fix the ISSUE, then
re-run the check: it reads the issue at run time, and a claim left pointing at a
scenario that no longer exists is reported as a warning, never a failure.
Editing an issue does not trigger a run by itself — re-run the workflow.

⚠️ FAILS CLOSED. If GitHub cannot be read, the check errors rather than
passing — a check that silently does not run is the BB #281 failure this must not
repeat. A PR that closes no issue (Dependabot), or closes only issues without
criteria (bugs), passes and says so.

Standard library only: it runs on a bare CI runner, before anything installs.
Usage: python scripts/check_criteria.py --pr <number>   (needs `gh`, GH_TOKEN)
