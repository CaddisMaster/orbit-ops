# BB #433 — put a release's docker-compose.yml in place on the Droplet.
#
# Runs ON the Droplet, from the deploy directory, piped in over ssh by
# release.yml and rollback.yml:
#
#   ssh ... "cd /opt/orbit-ops && sh -s -- <sha256> <version> <release|rollback>" \
#     < scripts/install_compose.sh
#
# The workflow has already streamed the file to `.docker-compose.yml.new` in the
# same directory. This script refuses it unless it hashes to what the runner
# checked out, then renames it over the live file. The rename is the atomic step:
# a dropped connection leaves at worst a stray `.new`, never a half-written
# compose file that every later command would read.
#
# Before BB #433 the file only ever arrived by a hand scp from the Mac, so nothing
# tied it to the image, and at 0.12.0 the two drifted apart (BB #432).
#
# ⚠️ THE db GUARD. Copying the file automatically removes the human who used to
# stand between "the repo edited the db service" and "the deploy's `up -d`
# recreated the database container" (RUNBOOK §5, "changing the db service at
# all"). So before installing, compare the config hash compose WOULD compute for
# `db` under the new file with the hash label on the running db container. That
# label is exactly what `up -d` compares to decide on a recreate, so a mismatch
# here is a recreate there, whatever the cause, including a compose upgrade that
# changed the hashing.
#   release  — refuse, leaving the old file in place: a db change is a scheduled
#              operation with a verified dump in hand, never a release side effect.
#   rollback — warn and install anyway: an incident is no time to be strict, and
#              rollback.yml never touches db (`up -d --no-deps`, db excluded).
