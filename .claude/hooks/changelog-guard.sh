# Stop hook: the CHANGELOG rule, evaluated locally instead of six minutes later.
#
# `.github/workflows/changelog.yml` fails a PR that changes `app/` without
# touching `CHANGELOG.md`. That check is required, so the cost of forgetting is
# a push, a CI round-trip and a second commit. The rule itself is two `git diff`
# calls, so there is no reason to learn it from a red check.
#
# ⚠️ Expect CHANGELOG.md conflicts when a session runs two PRs in parallel —
# both add under `## [Unreleased]`. That is normal and neither branch is wrong.
# This hook makes it marginally MORE likely by making the entry get written,
# which is the right trade.
#
# Twin of the ones in budget-buddy and material-list-import-tool. Keep them in step: a fix to the
# fail-open logic here is a fix there.
#
# ⚠️ This MIRRORS the workflow, it does not replace it. The workflow is the
# enforcement point; if the two ever disagree, the workflow is right. Scope is
# deliberately identical (`app/**` only) — widening it here would train everyone
# to reach for the escape hatch, which is the same reasoning the workflow's own
# comment gives for not covering test-only or workflow-only changes.
#
# THE ESCAPE HATCH IS NOT THE LABEL. `skip-changelog` lives on the PR and cannot
# be read from a local working tree, so this hook cannot honour it. Set
# SKIP_CHANGELOG_GUARD=1 in the environment instead. It also blocks at most
# once per stop (see stop_hook_active below), so it can never trap a session.
#
# FAILS OPEN, EVERYWHERE. Unparseable input, no git, no `main`, a detached HEAD,
# a missing tool — every one of them exits 0. A harness that blocks work because
# it cannot understand its own input is worse than no harness, and this one
# guards a rule that CI already enforces properly.

# Deliberately no `set -e`: a non-zero from any probe below must fall through to
# the fail-open exit at the bottom, not abort the script with an unknown status.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Hook input. Claude Code passes a JSON object on stdin carrying, among other
# things, `stop_hook_active` — true when the session is stopping BECAUSE a Stop
# hook already blocked it once. Honouring it is what makes a block a nudge
# rather than a trap: say your piece once, then get out of the way.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ If `stop_hook_active` cannot be READ, this hook must not block — an empty
# stdin, a reshaped payload or a missing python3 would otherwise mean blocking
# on every stop with no way to notice it had already spoken, which is the one
# failure mode that turns a nudge into a trap. Unknown state = stay quiet.
#
# ⚠️ THIS CLAIM WAS FALSE FOR A DICT WITH A RENAMED KEY UNTIL BB #339, and it was
# false in the one place this file argues hardest. `.get("stop_hook_active")`
# returns None without raising, so `{"stopHookActive": false}` — valid JSON,
# field renamed — was indistinguishable from an explicit `false` and the hook
# went on to block. The subscript below is the fix: an absent key raises and
# joins the unknown path, which is what the paragraph above always promised.
#
# Two things bound the blast radius even when everything here fails, recorded
# so the next person can size the risk rather than re-deriving it:
# Claude Code overrides a Stop hook after EIGHT consecutive blocks
# (`CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`), and `SKIP_CHANGELOG_GUARD=1` always works.
#
# ⚠️ `stop_hook_active` is sent UNCONDITIONALLY on Stop — measured against the
# installed Claude Code (2.1.260), whose payload is built as an object literal
# with the field always present and whose schema declares it required. That is
# why "absent = unknown" cannot silently disable this hook: absent means the
# shape genuinely changed. Re-measure before trusting this on a much later
# version, and note the embedded program must contain NO single quote — it is
# delimited by one.
